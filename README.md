## (Optional) Automating this process
It is possible to automate the process of starting RecycleBinCleaner by using the Windows built-in tool: **Task Scheduler**.

Windows 10:
1. In the start menu, search for: `Task Scheduler` and open it.
2. On the left hand side, select the folder `Task Scheduler Library` by **left clicking** it. This step is important.
3. Right click the folder `Task Scheduler` and select the option `New Folder`. Give your folder a meaningful name such as 'MyTasks'.
4. Now create a new task by right clicking your newly made  folder and select `Create basic task`.
5. Follow the steps untill you reach `Action`. Here you want to select `RecycleBinCleaner.exe` as the action to be performed. Leave the optional fields blank.
6. When you reach the `Finish` tab, you can check `Open the Properties dialog for this task when I click Finish` checkbox to further customize the task once it's created.
